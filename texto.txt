During today's visit to the ABA Center, the RBT observed several maladaptive behaviors exhibited by the child. These behaviors included non-compliance, climbing, off-seat behavior, inappropriate touching of a sexual nature, inappropriate social interactions, skin picking (referred to as SIN), and rocking behavior. To address these behaviors, the RBT implemented various replacement behaviors aimed at promoting more appropriate alternatives. These included encouraging the child to mand by pointing for specific desired items and activities, using a delay of reinforcement, engaging in competing activities as described in the intervention session, following hand signals, and choosing between two options. Moreover, the RBT encouraged the child to request breaks, remain seated, and use a hand signal to ask peers for single items. The session also focused on developing sharing skills, following one-step instructions, initiating activities or demands within five seconds, and maintaining appropriate hands during both structured and unstructured activities. The RBT used social reinforcement, namely access to a preferred activity, to reinforce appropriate behaviors. Specifically, interventions were applied to address specific maladaptive behaviors. For off-seat behavior, which was attributed to the child seeking attention from peers, the intervention consisted of antecedent environmental manipulation to manage the attention-seeking function. For climbing, which occurred when attention was not provided when desired, interventions included both antecedent environmental manipulation and differential reinforcement of alternate behaviors (DRA) to tackle the attention-seeking function. The RBT worked diligently to create an environment where these replacement behaviors were consistently reinforced, ultimately aiming to reduce the occurrence of maladaptive behaviors and promote more adaptive skills.
